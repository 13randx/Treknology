          <h3>WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT</h3>
          <div id="aboutbody">
            <p>
              Science fiction has been a repository for imaginative concepts for some time now, as either a foretelling of future technology or merely an influence. “It is now received wisdom that Western science fiction anticipated or even sparked future inventions.
              Famous examples are the prediction of debit cards in Edward Bellamy’s 1888 novel Looking Backward, antidepressants in Aldous Huxley’s 1931 Brave New World, and the first internet search engine in the 1978 BBC radio comedy The Hitchhiker’s
              Guide to the Galaxy” (Jacobs, S. 2015).
            </p>
            <p>
              Either way there has been numerous instances where a marvelous piece of equipment or handy gizmo had been introduced by TV shows and movies, only to become a real artifact for use today.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the 60’s when Star Trek originated, most of the technology on the show was far fetched science fiction, based little on actual scientific fact, and some were just a solution to a small budget or necessity driven (O’Connor, S. 2014). Yet some of
              these far fetched concepts have actually been produced or are even currently in production (Brown, S. & Logan, B. 2015).
            </p>
            <p>
              The point of this website is to explore a timeline based exploration of Star Trek technology, affectionately refered to as Treknology. The tech on the site comes from The Original Series (TOS), though improved in The Next Generation (TNG) and Voyager
              (VOY), but the real-world versions of this tech mostly drew inspriration from these TV shows. It hadn’t always been ivented on TOS per say, but the popularization was often enough to wet the appettites of budding scientists, inventors and dreamers.
            </p>
            <p>
              A trip through space is also a jaunt through the timeline of the real world tech available today. Even if TOS hadn’t necessarily invented the ideas of the future, it had a big hand in predicting and designing it. Gene Roddenberry, as with many other science
              fiction writers, was a visionary that could see the potential of possibility, and had an understanding of what was to come.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking forward, what’s next? Talk among scientists hypothesize that teleportation (or beaming) is already being explored. Warp speed may still be purely hypothetical, but augmented reality and smart operating systems with voice command are a work in
              progress. Phasers are still a work of fiction, although laser weapons are alegedly already being tested by the US military. Great strides are being made in robotics, so having a Data on the bridge may not be too far away. Universal translaters
              are, in effect, in baby stages, and NASA has begun work on the IXS Enterprise in preparation for space exploration by the turn of the century.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of the predictions of Star Trek that are already in use, though not currently featured here, are Google Glass, sliding doors, flashdrives, biometrics, GPS, and personal computers. Perhaps these and other items could make an appearance in the next update.

              <h3>COMMUNICATOR</h3>
              <p>
                The communicator appeared in episode 1 and continued until the end of TOS without change. Communicators use subspace transmissions that do not conform to normal rules of physics in that signals can bypass EM interference, and the devices allow nearly
                instantaneous communication at distances that would otherwise require more time to traverse.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dr. Martin Cooper, inventor of the first handheld mobile phone, credits the TOS communicator as being his inspiration for the technology behind the StarTAC flip phone. Fortunately it can’t be set to self destruct.
              </p>

              <h3>VIEWSCREEN</h3>
              <p>
                The viewscreen could take up the entire wall and was completely flat. Some smaller versions showed up in meeting rooms as well. They were used mainly in TOS for the crew on the bridge to view various positions immediately around the Enterprise, and later
                video communication not unlike Skype. The screens advanced in DS9 to a more holographic image produced by two side frame emitters.
              </p>
              <p>
                The flatscreen TV that the viewscreen was based on had technically already been invented in 1964 by the University of Illionois, however the kinks hadn’t been completely worked out so it couldn’t go to market. TOS popularized the notion, and by 1997 the
                plasma TV was selling at a meager $9000 a pop. Now it’s incorporated into most visual devices.

              <h3>WIRELESS RECEIVER</h3>
              <p>
                Uhura was rarely seen without the wireless receiver in her ear. It was worn almost like a piece of jewelry, and occasionally even sported by Spock. It was never really named officially in the series, sometimes referred to as just the ‘earpiece’. The function
                was to pick up any communications that were coming to the ship in any form.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bluetooth technology was developed in 2002 on the notion that technology should be able to talk wirelessly and synchronize without the structural complications of wires and cables. In the headset it became an inexpensive and low power solution.

              <h3>PADD</h3>
              <p>
                Starting out as the electronic clipboard in TOS, it was actually based on the RAND tablet in 1963.
                Both had a stylus and simulated writing on a digital pad. Kirk used it for note-taking and official sign-offs.
                It wasn’t until TNG in 1987 that it became the PADD (Personal Access Display Device) and worked the ship’s entire OS,
                called LCARS (Library Computer Access & Retreival System) interface. The PADD was designed, like so many things on Star Trek,
                due to a low budget. Because they couldn’t do anything too fancy, they made it all about the software, and Roddenberry’s vision of a simpler future was realized.
              <p>
                The tablet PC came about in waves, the closest and earliest version being the Cyrix WebPAD in 1998,
                but this still required a pen or stylus making it something in between the electronic clipboard and the PADD.
                It was in 2000 that Microsoft made the first prototype tablet PC and they hit the shelves in 2002.
                Interestingly (and perhaps not coincidentally), the PADD is resembled most by the iPad, which dominated from 2010 on and has all the touch capabilities the PADD promised.

              <h3>HYPOSPRAY</h3>
              <p>
                Dr. Hank McCoy made frequent use of the hypospray whenever a crew member required medicine. The hypospray required only medicine and pressure to administer into the injection. However, it was designed mostly because they couldn’t have needles on set.
              </p>
              <p>
                The jet injector was actually first patented in 1960. Invented by Aaron Ismach, it was a large and bulky version that required a foot pedal to operate and used for mass vaccinations. It was likely Roddenberry had heard of this. There were a few versions
                after TOS and TNG popularized it, but it wasn’t until 2012 that MIT made a proper jet injector the likes of the hypospray, with very little pain and improved efficiency.

              <h3>TRICORDER</h3>
              <p>
                The Tricorder was the standard landing party companion, usually adoned and exhibited by Spock.
                It was used mainly as a data sensor, analyzing, and  recording. It had a small display screen (which wasn’t quite flat),
                and a lot of flashy components that were rarely used, except for the knob which was turned like a tuner during nearly every use.
                It was big and clunky to start, but gradually became a small handheld device.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gene Roddenberry came up with the tricorder as  a useful device, but also what might be a fun toy for a young female.
                The first official version appeared in 1996 when Vital Technologies Corporation created and sold 10,000 of them.
                They called it the ‘TR-107 Tricorder Mark 1’ and it had funtions that included EMF metering, thermometer and barometer, "Colorimeter", "Light meter", and a clock and timer.
                Roddenberry stated in a contract that anyone who could produce the technology could use the name Tricorder, hence the name. It was in 2012 however,
                that the Scanadu medical device started hitting the shelves, and for a reasonable price. Incentivized by a contest with a large prize pool,
                the Scanadu is meant to diagnose patients at least a s good as actual medical doctors.

              <h3>REPLICATOR</h3>
              <p>
                Despite the recognition of the name, the Replicator actaully started as only a food synthesizor in TOS.
                Like the PADD, it wasn’t until TNG that it was referred to as a replicator. It used a similar technology to the teleporter,
                rearanging subatomic particles to replicate food, and later became sophisticated enough to create clothes or machine parts,
                and even could reverse and dispose of things as well.  Creating inanimate matter was easy as long as the molecular data was on file.
              </p>
              <p>
                Way back in 1934 a couple of scientists named Breit and Wheeler devised a theory on how to create matter from light.
                It’s rumored that at Imperial College’s Blackett Physics Laboratory in London, three physicists proved this theory.
                Fast forward to 1983, Chuck Hull invented the first 3D printer, actually capable of printing a real part.
                In 2009 this industry really started to take off, 3D printers selling commercially worldwide and in 2013 there was significant growth.
                They were considered to be the harbingers of the 3rd or 4th Industrial Revolution, and signs of replicating began to bloom.
                Companies like Makerbot seem to have significant growth and sells quite a few models, printing a large amount of materials,
                and in 2014 Nestle was reported to be creating a prototype akin to the ol’ food synthesizor of TOS,
                with the cababilty of producing tailored foods for personal nutritional requirements, Willy Wonka style.
